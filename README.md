# Hyprscroller

[Hyprscroller](https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller) is a
[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) layout plugin that creates a window layout
similar to [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM).

![Intro](./videos/hyprscroller.gif)

The plugin is quite feature complete and supports gaps, borders, decorations,
special workspace, full screen modes, overview, marks, pinned columns,
touchpad gestures, copying/pasting windows, trails/trailmarks, quick jump mode,
and installation through `hyprpm`.

Check the [Tutorial](./TUTORIAL.md) for a quick overview of *hyprscroller's* main
features.

I use *hyprscroller* on my main machine and will support it for as long as I
keep on using *Hyprland*. However, I will only add new features that I find
interesting, and support two *Hyprland* versions: the one my distribution uses,
and the latest tagged one. I have found problematic compiling trunk versions
of *Hyprland* on a system that already has a system-wide version of it
installed, so I will not make an extra effort there until things improve in
that front.


## Requirements

*hyprscroller* supports the version of *Hyprland* I use, which should be the
same as the Arch Linux `hyprland` package (v0.48.1). You can try your luck with the
latest `git` changes, but I will be slower to keep up with those, as there are
too many API changes going on upstream.

Aside from those two versions, even though the feature set will be frozen for
them, *hyprscroller* also supports most official Hyprland releases from v0.35
to the current one.


## Building and installing

The easiest and recommended mode to install *hyprscroller* is through `hyprpm`

### hyprpm

``` sh
hyprpm add https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller
# verify it installed correctly
hyprpm list
```

You can enable or disable it via `hyprpm enable hyprscroller` and
`hyprpm disable hyprscroller` or update it using `hyprpm update hyprscroller`.

Adding `exec-once = hyprpm reload -n` to your `hyprland.conf` will ensure all
your `hyprpm` managed plugins will be loaded at startup.

### Manually

If you want to build the plugin manually, it should be as simple as running

``` sh
# builds a shared object hyprscroller.so
make all
# installs the shared library in ~/.config/hypr/plugins
make install
```

then you can add the plugin to your `hyprland.conf`

``` conf
# path must be absolute
plugin = /home/xxxx/.config/hypr/plugins/hyprscroller.so
```

or load it temporarily using `hyprctl plugin`

``` sh
# path must be absolute
hyprctl plugin load /home/xxxx/.config/hypr/plugins/hyprscroller.so
```


### NixOS

*hyprscroller* is now an official unstable package in [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=hyprlandPlugins.hyprscroller),
so you can install it from there. I don't maintain *flakes* any more because
they were usually very out of date and I don't know enough about NixOS to keep
them alive. If you need a newer version than the NixOS package, I recommend you
temporarily use `hyprpm`.


## Configuration

If you are not using `hyprpm`, to make Hyprland load the plugin, add this to
your configuration.

``` conf
# path must be absolute
plugin = /home/xxxx/.config/hypr/plugins/hyprscroller.so
```

Instead, if you use `hyprpm`, it should be as simple as adding this to
your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` :

``` conf
exec-once = hyprpm reload -n
```

To turn on the layout, use

``` conf
general {
    ...

    layout = scroller

    ...
}
```


## Dispatchers

The plugin adds the following dispatchers:

| Dispatcher                    | Description                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scroller:movefocus`          | An optional replacement for `movefocus`, takes a direction as argument.                                                          |

## Modes

*Hyprscroller* works in any of two modes that can be changed at any moment.

1. *row* mode: it is the default. It creates new windows in a new column.
   `cyclesize` and `setsize` affect the width of the active column. `alignwindow` aligns
   the active column according to the argument received. `fitsize` fits the
   selected columns to the width of the monitor.

2. *column* mode: It creates new windows in the current column, right below the
   active window. `cyclesize` and `setsize` affect the height of the active window.
   `alignwindow` aligns the active window within the column, according to the
   argument received. `fitsize` fits the selected windows in the column to the
   height of the monitor.

### Mode Modifiers

Modes and mode modifiers are per *row* (workspace). Each *row* may have
different values.

At window creation time, *hyprscroller* can apply several modifiers to the
current working mode (*row/column*). The dispatcher `scroller:setmodemodifier`
can set any of them by taking the following parameters:

1. `position`: It is one of `after` (default), `before`, `end`, `beginning`.
This parameter decides the position of new windows: *after* the current one
(default value), *before* the current one, at the *end* of the row/column, or
at the *beginning* of the row/column.
2. `focus`: One of `focus` (default) or `nofocus`. When creating a new window,
this parameter decides whether it will get focus or not.
3. Automatic mode: `manual` (default) or `auto`. In the default *manual* mode,
you control window placement. When turning on `auto`, *hyprscroller* will work
in grid mode automatically. `auto` accepts an extra parameter: `number`.
In *row* mode, *hyprscroller* will wait for as many new windows as `number` per
column before creating a new column. In *column* mode, *hyprscroller* will
create as many as `number` columns before adding new windows to any of them.
If you close any window, `auto` mode will start filling the gaps with new
windows you create.
4. `center_column/nocenter_column`: It will keep the active column centered
(or not) on the screen. The default value is the one in your configuration.
See [center_active_column](https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller#center_active_column).
4. `center_window/nocenter_window`: It will keep the active window centered
(or not) in its column. The default value is the one in your configuration.
See [center_active_window](https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller#center_active_window).

You can skip any number of parameters when calling the dispatcher, and their
order doesn't matter.

You can change modifiers at any time using `scoller:setmodemodifier`, which
works like this:

```
# scroller:setmodemodifier, position, focus, auto:number, center_column, center_window
# examples
hyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier before, nofocus, auto:3
# creates new windows at the end of the row/column and doesn't focus on them
hyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier end, nofocus
# sets manual mode with no focus on new windows
hyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier , nofocus, manual
# default values
hyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier after, focus, manual
# sets auto mode with a grid of 4 windows
hyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier , auto:4
# keeps the active column always centered
hyprctl dispatch scroller:setmodemodifier , center_column
```

You can skip any parameters. If you don't specify some of them, they will merge
with the current set.

Add a submap to your key bindings configuration to use this feature more
easily:

```
# Set Mode Modifiers submap
# will switch to a submap called modifiers
bind = $mainMod, backslash, submap, modifiers
# will start a submap called "modifiers"
submap = modifiers
#
bind = , right, scroller:setmodemodifier, after
bind = , right, submap, reset
bind = , left, scroller:setmodemodifier, before
bind = , left, submap, reset
bind = , home, scroller:setmodemodifier, beginning
bind = , home, submap, reset
bind = , end, scroller:setmodemodifier, end
bind = , end, submap, reset
bind = , up, scroller:setmodemodifier, , focus
bind = , up, submap, reset
bind = , down, scroller:setmodemodifier, , nofocus
bind = , down, submap, reset
bind = , 2, scroller:setmodemodifier, , , auto, 2
bind = , 2, submap, reset
bind = , 3, scroller:setmodemodifier, , , auto, 3
bind = , 3, submap, reset
bind = , m, scroller:setmodemodifier, , , manual
bind = , m, submap, reset
# use reset to go back to the global submap
bind = , escape, submap, reset
# will reset the submap, meaning end the current one and return to the global one
submap = reset
```

There is also an IPC event with details of the current mode and modifiers.
Read [this](#ipc) for an example

You can also set a window rule for each new window to follow a certain
combination of mode and mode modifiers. See [window rules](#window-rules) for
more details.


## Window/Column Focus and Movement

*Hyprscroller* is now compatible with *Hyprland's* default `movefocus`/`movewindow`
dispatchers and key bindings. But you can also add *Hyprscroller's* own
`scroller:movefocus`/`scroller:movewindow` for cases unsupported by Hyprland,
like `beginning` and `end`. Supporting the default dispatcher allows for
better switching of layouts without needing to modify the configuration, which
was the case in the past.

`movefocus` and `movewindow` accept the following directional arguments:
`l` or `left`, `r` or `right`, `u` or `up`, `d` or `dn` or `down`, `b` or
`begin` or `beginning`, `e` or `end`. So you can focus or move windows/columns
in a direction or to the beginning or end or the row.

Additionally, `movewindow` accepts an additional, optional, parameter: `nomode`
If `nomode` is added to the dispatcher, movement will **only** move the active
window, leaving its column intact, regardless of which *mode* (row/column) you
are currently in. The movement will be like this:

If the window is in some column with other windows, any `left` or `right`
movement will `expel` it to that side, creating a new column with just that
window. Moving it again will `admit` it in the column in the direction of
movement, and so on. Moving the window `up` or `down` will simply move it in
its current column.


## Resizing

`cyclesize` accepts an argument which is either `+1`/`1`/`next`, or
`-1`/`prev`/`previous`. It cycles forward or backward through a number of column
widths (in *row* mode), or window heights (in *column* mode). Those widths or
heights are a fraction of the width or height of the monitor, and are
configurable (see *options*). However, using Hyprland's own dispatchers `resizeactive`
or `resizewindowpixel`, you can still modify the width or height of any window
freely.

`cyclewidth` is like `cyclesize`, but *cycle-sizes* the width of the column,
regardless of which mode you are in. `cycleheight` works similarly, but
resizing the active window's height.

`setsize`, `setwidth` and `setheight` are similar to their `cycle...`
counterparts, but instead of cycling, they set the width or height directly.
These dispatchers accept either an integer parameter, or a string.
If the parameter is an integer, it means an *index*, which is the zero-based
index in the `column_widths` array for `setwidth`, or `setsize` in row mode, or
the index in `window_heights` for `setheight`, or `setsize` in column mode.
If the parameter is a string containing one of the standard sizes, it sets the
column/window width/height to that fractional value (even if it is not within
your default sizes).

```
plugin {
    scroller {
        column_widths = onethird onehalf twothirds one
        window_heights = onethird onehalf twothirds one
    }
}
bind = $mainMod, 1, scroller:setwidth, 0  # sets width to onethird
bind = $mainMod, 2, scroller:setwidth, 1  # sets width to onehalf
bind = $mainMod, 3, scroller:setwidth, 2  # ...
bind = $mainMod, 4, scroller:setwidth, 3
...
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, 1, scroller:setheight, 0  # sets height to onethird
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, 2, scroller:setheight, 1  # sets height to onehalf
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, 3, scroller:setheight, 2  # ...
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, 4, scroller:setheight, 3
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, 5, scroller:setheight, oneeighth  # sets the height to oneeighth directly
...
```


## Aligning

Columns are generally aligned in automatic mode, always making the active one
visible, and trying to make at least the previously focused one visible too if
it fits the viewport, if not, the one adjacent on the other side. However, you
can always align any column to the *center*, *left* or *right* of the monitor
(in *row* mode), or *up* (top), *down* (bottom) or to the *center* in *column*
mode. For example center a column for easier reading, regardless of what happens to
the other columns. As soon as you change focus or move a column, the alignment
is lost. You can also center a window on your workspace using *middle*, it
will center its column, and also the window within the column.

`alignwindow` takes a parameter: `l` or `left`, `r` or `right`, `c` or
`center` or `centre`, `u` or `up`, `d` or `down`, and `m` or `middle`.

To use *right* or *left* you need to be in *row* mode, and to use *up* or
*down* in *column* mode. *center* behaves differently depending on the mode.
In *row* mode it aligns the active column to the center of the monitor. In
*column* mode, it aligns the active window within its column, to a centered
position. If you want to center a window and its column at the same time,
regardless of which mode you are in, use *middle*.


## Admit/Expel

You can create columns of windows using `admitwindow`. It takes an optional
direction parameter `l/left` (default) or `r/right`. The dispatcher takes the
active window and moves it to the column in the parameter direction from its
current one, right under the active window in that column.

To expel any window from its current column and position it in a new column to
its right or left, use `expelwindow`. It also takes the same `l/left` or `r/right`
(default) parameter.


## Fitting the Screen

When you have a ultra-wide monitor, one in a vertical position, or the default
column widths or window heights don't fit your workflow, you can use manual
resizing, but it is sometimes slow and tricky.

`scroller:fitsize` works in two different ways, depending on the active mode.

It allows you to re-fit the columns (*row* mode) or windows (*column* mode) you
want to the screen extents. It accepts an argument related to the
columns/windows it will try to fit. The new width/height of each column/window
will be proportional to its previous width or height, relative to the other
columns or windows affected.

1. `active`: It is similar to maximize, it will fit the active column/window.
2. `visible`: All the currently fully or partially visible columns/windows will
   be resized to fit the screen.
3. `all`: All the columns in the row or windows in the column will be resized
   to fit.
4. `toend`: All the columns or windows from the focused one to the end of the
   row/column will be affected.
5. `tobeg` or `tobeginning`: All the columns/windows from the focused one to
   the beginning of the row/column will now fit the screen.

`fitwidth` and `fitheight` accept the same arguments as `fitsize`, but work
for the current *row* (`fitwidth`) or the active *column* (`fitheight`),
regardless of your current *row/column* mode. They provide a direct way to
fit windows without having to change the current working mode.


## Overview

`scroller:toggleoverview` toggles a bird's eye view of the current workspace where
all the windows are scaled to fit the current monitor. You can still interact
with the windows normally (change focus, move windows, create or destroy them,
type in them etc.). Use it as a way to see where things are and move the active
focus, or reposition windows. You can even have all your windows in full screen
mode and use *overview* to navigate among them quickly.

*Overview* is affected by the option `overview_scale_content`, which is by
default `true`, meaning the windows' content will be scaled in the same
proportion as the windows. If your system doesn't support this (currently only
supported on x86_64 -Intel/AMD CPUs), the default value will be `false`. If
you simply want to have the content at the original size, you can also turn
this option manually to `false`.

## Jump

`scroller:jump` provides a shortcut-based quick focus mode for any window on
the active workspaces, similar to [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)
and variations.

It shows all the windows on your monitors' active workspaces in overview, and
waits for a combination of key presses (overlaid on each window) to quickly
change focus to the selected window. Pressing any key that is not on the list or
a combination that doesn't exist, exits jump mode without changes.

Depending on the total number of windows and keys you set on your list, you
will have to press more or less times. Each window has its full combination
on the overlay.

You can call `jump` from any mode: overview, full screen or normal mode.

There are four options related to `scroller:jump`:
`plugin:scroller:jump_labels_font`, `plugin:scroller:jump_labels_color`,
`plugin:scroller:jump_labels_scale` and `plugin:scroller:jump_labels_keys`.
These options are explained in detail in **Options**.

## Marks

You can use *marks* to navigate to frequently used windows, regardless of
which workspace they are in (it even works for the special workspace windows).

`scroller:marksadd` adds a named mark. Use a *submap* to create bindings for
several named marks you may want to use. See the configuration example for
directions.

`scroller:marksdelete` deletes a named mark created with `scroller:marksadd`.

`scroller:marksvisit` moves the focus to a previously created mark.

`scroller:marksreset` clears all marks.

Marks reference windows, but are global, they may belong to different
workspaces, so visiting a mark may switch workspaces.

You can use any string name for a mark, for example in scripts. But they are
also very convenient to use with regular key bindings by simply using a letter
as the name. Again, see the example configuration.

*hyprscroller* generates IPC signals for mark events, and in this
README there is an example implementation for [ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags)
to use those signals to display information on your desktop bar.

If you want more advanced functionality for *marks*, including some nice UI
to view which ones are set and navigate them, see
[this](https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller/issues/101#issue-2757080105)
script and comment by `CRAG666`

## Pinning a Column

`scroller:pin` manages *pinned* columns (toggles *pinned* status). Having a
column *pinned* is useful to keep some column as an immovable reference; for
example some documentation or important code you want to always have available
while changing focus to other columns.

`scroller:pin` will *pin* a column if none is *pinned*, otherwise will *unpin*
the *pinned* one. So to move the *pin* from one column to another, call
`scroller:pin` twice, one to *unpin* the currently *pinned* one, and the
second to *pin* the active column.

There can only be one *pinned* column per workspace. The column will stay in
place while the flag is on. That means the rest of the columns (even the
active one) will not perturb that position. When changing focus, the *active* 
column will be seen on the screen as long as it fits on either side of the
*pinned* column.

*hyprscroller* sets a special `tag` (`scroller:pinned`) on windows belonging
to a pinned column. You can use this tag to create window rules affecting
these windows. For example, to change their border colors:

```
windowrulev2 = bordercolor rgb(eeee00) rgb(00eeee), tag: scroller:pinned
```


## Window Copying/Pasting

`scroller:selectiontoggle` and `scroller:selectionreset` manage window/column
selections. You can select several windows at a time, even in different
workspaces and/or from overview mode. Those windows will change the border
color to the one specified in the option `plugin:scroller:col.selection_border`.

Once you have made a selection, you can move those windows to a different
workspace or location in the same workspace using `scroller:selectionmove`.
The selection order and column/window configuration will be maintained.

`scroller:selectionworkspace` will add every window of the current workspace
to the selection. You can use this when you want to move one workspace to a
different one, but keeping windows positions and sizes. Use
`scroller:selectionworkspace`, and then `scroller:selectionmove` where you
want the windows to appear.

`scroller:selectionmove` accepts a direction as parameter. Valid directions
are:

1. `r` or `right`: Move the selection to the current workspace, locating it
   right of the active column.
2. `l` or `left`: Move the selection to the current workspace, locating it
   left of the active column.
3. `b`, `begin`, or `beginning`: Move the selection to the current workspace,
   locating it at the beginning (first column).
4. `e` or `end`: Move the selection to the current workspace, locating it at
   the end (last column).


## Trails and Trailmarks

Trails and Trailmarks are a concept borrowed from [trailblazer.nvim](https://github.com/LeonHeidelbach/trailblazer.nvim).

A **trailmark** is like an anonymous mark on a window, and a **trail** is a
collection of trailmarks. You can have as many trails as you want, and as many
trailmarks as you want in any trail. Each window can be in as many trails
as you want too.

Creating your first trailmark (`trailmarktoggle`) will create a trail. From
then on, every trailmark you create will be assigned to that trail. You can
navigate back (`trailmarkprevious`) and forth (`trailmarknext`) within the
collection of trailmarks contained in the trail.

To create a new trail, use `trailnew`. With `trailprevious` and `trailnext`
you can navigate trails, changing the active one. The active trail will be
the one used for the trailmark dispatchers (toggle, next, and previous).

Clear all the trailmarks of the active trail using `trailclear`, or delete
the trail from the list with `traildelete`.

`trailtoselection` creates a selection list from the trailmarks in the active
trail. You can use that selection for example to move all the windows to a new
workspace using `selectionmove`.

*hyprscroller* generates IPC signals for trail/trailmark events, and in this
README there is an example implementation for [ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags)
to use those signals to display information on your desktop bar.

See the key bindings section for an example on how to set bindings for trail
and trailmark dispatchers.


## Touchpad Gestures

There are options to enable/disable touchpad gestures for scrolling, `overview`
and `workspace` change.

The default for scrolling is swiping with three fingers to scroll left, right,
up or down. Four fingers up enables the *overview* mode, down disables it.
To change workspace, swipe right or left, also with four fingers.

When swiping vertically (a column), *hyprscroller* will scroll the column
that contains the mouse pointer. This allows you to scroll columns that are
not the active one if your Hyprland `input:follow_mouse` setting decouples focusing
from mouse pointer position (value other than `1`). Read Hyprland's
[Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Variables/#input) for more details.

You can enable/disable any of the three gestures. But if you want to have the
three enabled, note that scrolling needs the two axes, horizontal and
vertical, while overview only uses the vertical, and workspace switching the
horizontal axis. That means, you will want to share `_fingers` (see
**Options**) for overview and workspace switching, while leaving scrolling on
its own `_fingers` value. The default accounts for that, so leave it as it is
unless your touchpad supports gestures with more fingers and you want to use
that.

*hyprscroller* touchpad gestures respect the global option
`input:touchpad:natural_scroll` and provide several others specific to the
plugin to tweak gestures behavior. You can find them in the **Options** section
of this document.

**Note**: Hyprland's `workspace_swipe` will be disabled while using
*hyprscroller*. Please, use the provided workspace change swipe gesture (four
fingers right/left by default, but you can change the number of fingers).

Hyprland doesn't understand windows in a workspace can exist outside of the viewport, so
`workspace_swipe` will not work, as it renders those windows thinking they are in
a different workspace, creating a small mess of windows. If you have forgotten
to disable it, *hyprscroller* will have to turn off three finger gestures until
you disable `workspace_swipe`.


## IPC

*hyprscroller* sends IPC messages in certain situations, in the same way
[*hyprland* does](https://wiki.hyprland.org/IPC/). These are currently the
events that trigger a message:

| Message                | Occurs when                | Data                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `scroller admitwindow` | admitting a window         |                                                     |
| `scroller expelwindow` | expelling a window         |                                                     |
| `scroller overview`    | toggling overview mode     | `0/1`                                               |
| `scroller mode`        | changing mode or modifiers | `row/column`, `position`, `focus`, `auto`, `number` |
| `scroller mark`        | current window marked?     | `0/1`, `mark_name`                                  |
| `scroller trail`       | current trail information  | `number`, `size`                                    |
| `scroller trailmark`   | current window trailmark?  | `0/1`                                               |

You can use these events to show messages, or modify your bar. This simple
script captures the events and shows a notification each time:

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

function handle {
  if [[ ${1:0:8} == "scroller" ]]; then
    if [[ ${1:10:11} == "overview, 0" ]]; then
        hyprctl notify -1 3000 "rgb(ff1ea3)" "Normal mode!"
    elif [[ ${1:10:11} == "overview, 1" ]]; then
        hyprctl notify -1 3000 "rgb(ff1ea3)" "Overview mode!"
    elif [[ ${1:10:9} == "mode, row" ]]; then
        hyprctl notify -1 3000 "rgb(ff1ea3)" "Row mode!"
    elif [[ ${1:10:12} == "mode, column" ]]; then
        hyprctl notify -1 3000 "rgb(ff1ea3)" "Column mode!"
    elif [[ ${1:10:11} == "admitwindow" ]]; then
        hyprctl notify -1 3000 "rgb(ff1ea3)" "Admit Window!"
    elif [[ ${1:10:11} == "expelwindow" ]]; then
        hyprctl notify -1 3000 "rgb(ff1ea3)" "Expel Window!"
    fi
  fi
}

socat - "UNIX-CONNECT:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/.socket2.sock" | while read -r line; do handle "$line"; done
```

### Using IPC in AGS

For those using [ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) to create the desktop bar,
this is a module example on how you could use *hyprscroller* IPC events to show
the current mode (*row* or *column*), whether we are in *overview* mode or not,
your current trail (and its number of trailmarks), and whether the current
window contains a trailmark or not.

``` js
import Gio from 'gi://Gio'
import GLib from 'gi://GLib'

export function Scroller() {
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();
    const mode_label = Widget.Label({
        class_name: "scroller-mode",
        label: ''
    });
    const overview_label = Widget.Label({
        class_name: "scroller-overview",

    });
    const mark_label = Widget.Label({

        label: ''
    });
    const trailmark_label = Widget.Label({
        class_name: "scroller-trailmark",
        label: ''
    });
    const trail_label = Widget.Label({
        class_name: "scroller-trail",

### Using IPC with Waybar

[This comment](https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller/issues/57#issuecomment-2418305146)
by Chen-Yulin provides code to use *hyprscroller's* IPC messages with
[waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar).


## Options

*hyprscroller* currently accepts the following options:

### `column_default_width`

Determines the width of new columns in *row* mode.
Possible arguments are: `oneeighth`, `onesixth`, `onefourth`, `onethird`,
`threeeighths`, `onehalf` (default), `fiveeighths`, `twothirds`, `threequarters`,
`fivesixths`, `seveneighths`, `one`.

### `window_default_height`

Determines the default height of a new window. This is useful if you are using
a monitor in portrait mode and *column* mode.
Possible arguments are: `oneeighth`, `onesixth`, `onefourth`, `onethird`,
`threeeighths`, `onehalf`, `fiveeighths`, `twothirds`, `threequarters`,
`fivesixths`, `seveneighths`, `one` (default).

### `focus_wrap`

Determines whether focus will *wrap* when at the first or
last window of a row/column. Possible arguments are: `true`|`1` (default), or
`false`|`0`.

### `focus_edge_ms`

When your Hyprland setting for `input:follow_mouse` is `0` or `1`, Hyprland
will change focus to the window where your mouse cursor is. *hyprscroller*
can have windows outside of the viewport. If your `gaps_out` setting allows
you to see part of those windows, mouse focusing can trigger a refocus when
your mouse is over the gap at the edge of the monitor. This can sometimes
create a series of unwanted focusing events that move focus away, and can be
quite distracting.

`focus_edge_ms` is a timeout value (default is 400 ms). When your mouse is
over the edge of the monitor's gap, refocusing on the window under that gap
will be delayed for this time value. If you didn't want to focus, you can
still escape! If you actually want to scroll and focus, keep the mouse inside
the gap for the timeout value. On your next mouse movement, *hyprscroller*
will scroll to the partially seen window. Note you need to move your mouse
again after the timeout value, this is attached to the `mouseMove` event, so
even if you keep the mouse over the gap for longer than the timeout, the
event won't be triggered until your next mouse movement. The easiest way to
scroll is to flick the mouse inside and outside of the gap to make sure you
only scroll once.

### `cyclesize_wrap`

If `true`, `cyclesize`, `cyclewidth` and `cycleheight` will cycle through all
the respective sizes defined in `column_widths` and `window_heights` infinitely,
in a cycle. This is the default behavior. If you prefer cycling not to *wrap*
(just one cycle), set this option to `0/false`. Cycling will then stop at the
first size if you call `prev`, and at the last size if you call `next`.
Possible arguments are: `true`|`1` (default), or `false`|`0`.

### `cyclesize_closest`

If `true`, when a window/column has been manually resized or is not of one
of the standard sizes in `window_heights`/`column_widths`, calling one of the
`cyclesize` dispatchers will resize it to the closest available size in
`window_heights`/`column_widths`. If `false`, the window/column will adopt its
default size instead (`window_default_height`/`column_default_width`).
Possible arguments are: `true`|`1` (default), or `false`|`0`.

### `center_row_if_space_available`

If there is empty space in the viewport, the row will be centered, leaving the
same amount of empty space on each side (respecting `gaps_out`). Possible
arguments are: `false`|`0` (default), or `true`|`1`.

### `center_active_column`

It `true`, the active column will always be centered on the screen. Possible
values for the argument are: `false`|`0` (default), or `true`|`1`.

### `center_active_window`

It `true`, the active window (active window of the active column) will always
be centered on the screen. Possible values for the argument are:
`false`|`0` (default), or `true`|`1`.

### `overview_scale_content`

Scales the content of the windows in overview mode, like GNOME/MacOS/Windows
overview mode. Possible arguments are: `true`|`1` (default), or
`false`|`0`.

### `col.selection_border`

It is the color of the border of selected windows. The default value is
`0xff9e1515`, which is `red`.

### `jump_labels_font`

It is a string with the font to use for `jump` labels. If omitted, the default
is to use whatever you have set as default for Hyprland (`misc:font_family`).

### `jump_labels_color`

Color of the text for the `jump` labels. The default is `0x80159e30`, which
is a tone of green.

### `jump_labels_scale`

`jump` labels will be centered in each window, and this parameter scales their
size. The default is `0.5`. `1.0` would make the label fit the full size of
the window, and it's the maximum allowed, `0.1` is the minimum allowed, and
would make the label's box size 10% of the width and height of the window.

### `jump_labels_keys`

It is a string with the keys that will be used for the labels. The default is
`1234`, which means labels will show a unique combination of `1`, `2`, `3` and
`4`. The more keys you set on this option, the shorter the combination of key
presses to reach any window, but some times, reaching for those keys can be
slower. Some people prefer to use `qwerasdf` which provides a shorter label
and good reachability. The perfect combination depends on how you use
your keyboard.

### `column_widths`

Determines the set of column widths *hyprscroller* will
cycle through when resizing the width of a column in *row* mode. It is a string
of any number of values chosen among: *oneeighth, onesixth, onefourth, onethird,
threeeighths, onehalf, fiveeighths, twothirds, threequarters, fivesixths,
seveneighths, one*. The default value is: *onethird onehalf twothirds one*.

### `window_heights`

Determines the set of window heights *hyprscroller* will
cycle through when resizing the height of a window in *column* mode. It is a
string of any number of values chosen among: *oneeighth, onesixth, onefourth,
onethird, threeeighths, onehalf, fiveeighths, twothirds, threequarters,
fivesixths, seveneighths, one*. The default value is:
*onethird onehalf twothirds one*.

### `monitor_options`

**NOTE:** This option **deprecates** `monitor_modes`. Please, update your
configuration if you are using it.

`monitor_options` can be used to define different default options for each
monitor. Currently, the supported options are:

1. `mode`: `r/row` for *row* mode and `c/col/column` for *column* mode.
2. `column_default_width`: Possible values are the same as the global
   `column_default_width` option.
3. `window_default_height`: Possible values are the same as the global
   `window_default_height` option.
4. `column_widths`: Similar to the global option.
5. `window_heights`: Similar to the global option.

When you create a workspace in any monitor, instead of defaulting to the
global options, it will read them from this configuration value. For any
monitor or option not defined in this variable, the option will default to the
global one.

Monitor names can be inferred by running `hyprctl monitors` and using the
returned names.

```
Monitor HDMI-A-1 (ID 0):
	3840x2160@59.99700 at 0x0
    ...
```

means the name you need to use is HDMI-A-1.

`monitor_options` is a list with the following format:

```
monitor_options = (DP-2 = (mode = row; column_default_width = onehalf; column_widths = onethird onehalf twothirds; window_default_height = one), HDMI-A-1 = (mode = col; column_default_width = one; window_default_height = onehalf))
```

The list of monitors is encapsulated by `()` and separated by `,`. Each
monitor entry consists of the name of the monitor followed by `=` and a list
of options enclosed by `()`, with each option separated by `;`, as in the
example above. Spaces are allowed anywhere for better readability.

This option is useful to configure ultra-wide monitors or those in non-standard
orientations (for example portrait instead of landscape). You can define any
combination. You can also use a configuration per monitor when you have very
different geometries, for example a laptop and an external, bigger monitor.

### `gesture_sensitivity`

This is a positive floating point value. The default is `1.0`. If you want to make
scrolling more sensitive, increase the value (`2.0` for example). If it is too
sensitive, try using a fraction of `1.0` (`0.5` for example).

### `gesture_scroll_enable`

`true` (default) or `false`. Enables or disables touchpad gestures for
scrolling (changing focus).

### `gesture_scroll_fingers`

Integer value, default is `3`. Number of fingers used to swipe when scrolling.

### `gesture_overview_enable`

`true` (default) or `false`. Enables or disables touchpad gestures to call
*overview* mode.

### `gesture_overview_fingers`

Integer value, default is `4`. Number of fingers used to swipe for overview.

If you want to use gestures for both overview and workspace switch, you should
set the same `_fingers` value for both. *overview* will use the vertical axis
and workspace switch the horizontal one. If you set a different number of
fingers for each, make sure your touchpad accepts gestures with that number
of fingers.

### `gesture_overview_distance`

Integer value, default is `5`. Delta generated by swiping to call *overview*
mode. It is like a sensitivity value; the smaller, the
easier it will be to trigger the command. Each swipe triggers it only once,
regardless of the length or the swipe.

### `gesture_workspace_switch_enable`

`true` (default) or `false`. Enables or disables touchpad gestures for
workspace switching.

### `gesture_workspace_switch_fingers`

Integer value, default is `4`. Number of fingers used to swipe for a workspace
change.

If you want to use gestures for both overview and workspace switch, you should
set the same `_fingers` value for both. *overview* will use the vertical axis
and workspace switch the horizontal one. If you set a different number of
fingers for each, make sure your touchpad accepts gestures with that number
of fingers.

### `gesture_workspace_switch_distance`

Integer value, default is `5`. Delta generated by swiping to change workspace.
It is like a sensitivity value; the smaller, the easier it will be to trigger
the command. Each swipe triggers it only once, regardless of the length or the
swipe.

### `gesture_workspace_switch_prefix`

String value (one character). The default is "". It is the prefix used when
calling the dispatcher to switch to a different workspace. Read [Workspaces](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Dispatchers/#workspaces)
in the Hyprland wiki to understand in detail what each prefix means.

The *prefix* value will be concatenated to `+1` or `-1` to change workspace
when swiping to one side or the other. For example:

``` conf
# Default: swith to the next/previous workspace, regardless of monitor
plugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix =
# swith to a workspace on the current monitor
plugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix = m
# swith to a workspace on the current monitor, including empty workspaces
plugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix = r
# swith to the next/previous open workspace
plugin:scroller:gesture_workspace_switch_prefix = e
```


### Options Example

``` conf
plugin {
    scroller {
        column_default_width = onehalf
        focus_wrap = false
        # ultra-wide monitor
        column_widths = onefourth onethird onehalf onesixth
        # portrait mode monitors
        monitor_options = (DP-2 = (mode = row; column_default_width = onehalf; column_widths = onethird onehalf twothirds one; window_default_height = one), HDMI-A-1 = (mode = col; column_default_width = one; window_default_height = onehalf))
    }
}
```


## Window Rules

*hyprscroller* provides a number of static Window Rules v2 that can be
triggered at window creation time.

Aside from those, *hyprscroller* also sets some properties on certain windows,
so you can also apply general Hyprland rules to them.

[Hyprland's Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/)
explains what Window Rules are, and how to enable and configure them.

### Static Window Rules

These are rules specific to *hyprscroller*

#### modemodifier

Use this rule when you want to open a certain window overriding the current
mode or its modifiers. This doesn't change the mode or its modifiers, it only
affects the window matching the rule.

**Syntax of rule:** `plugin:scroller:modemodifier row|column after|before|end|beginning focus|nofocus`

For example, the following rule will always open kitty windows in column mode,
before the active window and won't focus on the new window.

```
windowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:modemodifier col before nofocus, class:(kitty)
```


#### group

You may want to keep every window of the same class, type etc. in the same
column. For example, in [#45](https://github.com/dawsers/hyprscroller/issues/45),
a user wants to open all the plot windows for a Python script in the same
column.

**Syntax of rule:** `plugin:scroller:group group_name`

```
windowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:group python_plots, class:(python3)
```

#### alignwindow

Aligns the new opened window. Works in the same way as the `alignwindow`
dispatcher.

**Syntax of rule:** `plugin:scroller:alignwindow position`

Center any new Firefox window.

```
windowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:alignwindow center, class:(firefox)
```

#### marksadd

Add a named mark to a window.

**Syntax of rule:** `plugin:scroller:marksadd name`

Add a mark named `m` to Thunderbird's main window as soon as it's opened. This
will let you navigate to Thunderbird from wherever you are by using a
`marksvisit` key binding. I use `Super + ' + m` to set the focus on Thunderbird.

```
windowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:marksadd m, class:(thunderbird),title:(Mozilla Thunderbird)$
```

#### columnwidth

Overrides the default width of the column containing the window.

**Syntax of rule:** `plugin:scroller:columnwidth width`

Open any Firefox window with a width of `twothirds`

```
windowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:columnwidth twothirds, class:(firefox)
```

#### windowheight

Overrides the default height of the new window.

**Syntax of rule:** `plugin:scroller:windowheight height`

Open any Firefox window with a height of `onehalf`

```
windowrulev2 = plugin:scroller:windowheight onehalf, class:(firefox)
```

### Hyprscroller Properties for Window Rules

*hyprscroller* allows you to apply general window rules to some of its windows
by using *tags*. These are automatic *tags* *hyprscroller* sets:

#### scroller:pinned

Windows belonging to a pinned column are tagged `scroller:pinned`. You can use
this tag to modify their behavior. For example, to change their border colors:

```
windowrulev2 = bordercolor rgb(eeee00) rgb(00eeee), tag: scroller:pinned
```


## Key bindings

As an example, you could set some key bindings in your `hyprland.conf` like this:

``` conf
